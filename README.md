# RE4 EFX Template
EFX 010 template for Resident Evil 4 Remake.

**UPDATE 4/3/2025**

Template structure rewritten. Now supports most efx files for RE4.

Note that this version of the efx template is temporary and will soon become obsolete when I release the new version with support for MH Wilds and more.

The **EFX_COLOR_CHANGE.1sc** script allows you to change the color of all entries in an EFX file. To use it, first install it under Scripts > View Install Scripts > Add.

Then with an EFX file open, run the script from the Scripts menu.

There are configurable options if you open the script file. You can enable or disable changing the colors of certain structs and also set the default colors.

The script is not intended to do all of the work. It will not work perfectly in all cases and you may have to manually tweak some things.

## Installation
Requires **[010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/)**

Install the template under Templates > View Installed Templates > Add
